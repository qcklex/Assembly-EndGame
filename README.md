#  Assembly : Endgame

Welcome to **Assembly: Endgame**, a twist on the classic Hangman game where the stakes are higher! Instead of simply guessing letters, every incorrect guess results in the tragic demise of a beloved programming language. Will you save them all, or will you bid farewell to your favorites? 👾💻

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Each incorrect guess "kills" a programming language in real-time.
- **React-Powered:** Built with React for a smooth and interactive user experience.
- **Custom Word List:** Challenge yourself with a selection of random words.
- **Language Survival Tracker:** Keep track of the programming languages you've saved and the ones you've lost.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-programming-languages.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Start the game by clicking on any keyboard letter.
2. Guess the word by selecting letters.
3. For every incorrect guess, a programming language "dies" (it becomes ☠️).
4. The game ends when:
   - You guess the word correctly (Congratulations! 🎉).
   - All programming languages have "died" (Game Over 😢).
